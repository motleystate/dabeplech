Why dabeplech?
***********

The main motivation behind dabeplech is to provide a simple way to query bioinformatics API.

It is also designed in a way to ease any contributions and try to keep its structure as simple as possible.

This library contains models description (thanks to pydantic_). It allows validations of the format and the generation
of a documentation of the responses from APIs that are initially not described or following any standards.
