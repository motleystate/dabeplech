Why BioAPI?
***********

The main motivation behind BioAPI is to provide a simple way to query bioinformatics API.

It is also designed in a way to ease any contributions and try to keep its structure as simple as possible.

This library also contains models description (thanks to pydantic_). It allows validations and generating
documentation of the responses from APIs that are initially not described or following any standards.
