Completing the Documentation
****************************

In order to increase visibility while adding a new API connector to the library, we also
encourage you add information to the documentation. For this you can edit the following pages:

- ``user_guide/supported_api.rst``: add it to the list with a sentence to describe it.
- ``user_guide/api_services.rst``: use ``automodule`` to add automatically generated documentation of the new API connector.

.. Note::
    Adding information on the present documentation also help increasing visibility of the
    added API.
